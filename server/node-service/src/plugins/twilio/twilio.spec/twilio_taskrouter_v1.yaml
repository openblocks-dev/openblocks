                    allows Workers to handle multiple Tasks simultaneously. When enabled
                    (`true`), each Worker can receive parallel reservations up to
                    the per-channel maximums defined in the Workers section. In single-tasking
                    mode (legacy mode), each Worker will only receive a new reservation
                    when the previous task is completed. Learn more at [Multitasking](https://www.twilio.com/docs/taskrouter/multitasking).'

                    create a Workspace with only a set of default activities. `FIFO`
                    will configure TaskRouter with a set of default activities and
                    a single TaskQueue for first-in, first-out distribution, which
                    can be useful when you are getting started with TaskRouter.'
