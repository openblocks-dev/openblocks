                    if you pass in `Parameters={"name":"Zeke"}`, a widget in your
                    Flow can reference the variable `{{flow.data.name}}`, which returns
                    "Zeke". Note: the JSON value must explicitly be passed as a string,
                    not as a hash object. Depending on your particular HTTP library,
                    you may need to add quotes or URL encode the JSON string.'
