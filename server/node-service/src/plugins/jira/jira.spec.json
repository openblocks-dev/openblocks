Available only for authenticated requests made by Connect Apps (read more here: [Authentication for Connect apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/)).\n *  `issue` ([Issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): The current issue. Available only when the issue is provided in the request context object.\n *  `issues` ([List](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#list) of [Issues](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): A collection of issues matching a JQL query. Available only when JQL is provided in the request context object.\n *  `project` ([Project](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#project)): The current project. Available only when the project is provided in the request context object.\n *  `sprint` ([Sprint](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#sprint)): The current sprint. Available only when the sprint is provided in the request context object.\n *  `board` ([Board](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#board)): The current board. Available only when the board is provided in the request context object.\n *  `serviceDesk` ([ServiceDesk](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#servicedesk)): The current service desk. Available only when the service desk is provided in the request context object.\n *  `customerRequest` ([CustomerRequest](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#customerrequest)): The current customer request. Available only when the customer request is provided in the request context object.\n\nAlso, custom context variables can be passed in the request with their types. Those variables can be accessed by key in the Jira expression. These variable types are available for use in a custom context:\n\n *  `user`: A [user](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user) specified as an Atlassian account ID.\n *  `issue`: An [issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue) specified by ID or key. All the fields of the issue object are available in the Jira expression.\n *  `json`: A JSON object containing custom content.\n *  `list`: A JSON list of `user`, `issue`, or `json` variable types.\n\nThis operation can be accessed anonymously.\n\n**[Permissions](#permissions) required**: None. However, an expression may return different results for different users depending on their permissions. For example, different users may see different comments on the same issue.  \nPermission to access Jira Software is required to access Jira Software context variables (`board` and `sprint`) or fields (for example, `issue.sprint`).",

Transitions may be applied, to move the issues or subtasks to a workflow step other than the default start step, and issue properties set.\n\nThe content of each issue or subtask is defined using `update` and `fields`. The fields that can be set in the issue or subtask are determined using the [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get). These are the same fields that appear on the issues' create screens. Note that the `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document Format content. Single line custom fields (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.\n\nCreating a subtask differs from creating an issue as follows:\n\n *  `issueType` must be set to a subtask issue type (use [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get) to find subtask issue types).\n *  `parent` the must contain the ID or key of the parent issue.\n\n**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects* and *Create issues* [project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project in which each issue or subtask is created.",

If a user has the required permission, the clause is not sanitized. If the account ID is null, sanitizing is performed for an anonymous user.\n\nNote that sanitization doesn't make the queries GDPR-compliant, because it doesn't remove user identifiers (username or user key). If you need to make queries GDPR-compliant, use [Convert user identifiers to account IDs in JQL queries](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-jql/#api-rest-api-3-jql-sanitize-post).\n\nBefore sanitization each JQL query is parsed.

        "description": "Returns all permission schemes.\n\n### About permission schemes and grants ###\n\nA permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.\n\n#### Holder object ####\n\nThe `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the *Administer projects* permission is granted to a group named *Teams in space administrators*. In this case, the type is `\"type\": \"group\"`, and the parameter is the group name, `\"parameter\": \"Teams in space administrators\"` and the value is group ID, `\"value\": \"ca85fac0-d974-40ca-a615-7af99c48d24f\"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:\n\n *  `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).\n *  `parameter` As a group's name can change, use of `value` is recommended. The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.\n *  `value` The value of this property depends on the `type`. If the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group ID. For other `type` it has the same value as `parameter`\n\nThe following `types` are available. The expected values for `parameter` and `value` are given in parentheses (some types may not have a `parameter` or `value`):\n\n *  `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.\n *  `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name, application name). See [Update product access settings](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3YxjL) for more information.\n *  `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.\n *  `group` Grant for the specified group (`parameter` : group name, `value` : group ID).\n *  `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).\n *  `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.\n *  `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (`parameter` :project role ID, `value` : project role ID).\n *  `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.\n *  `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.\n *  `user` Grant for the specified user (`parameter` : user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used, `value` : user ID).\n *  `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).\n\n#### Built-in permissions ####\n\nThe [built-in Jira permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/) and [global permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/global-permission/) module documentation for more information.\n\n**Project permissions**\n\n *  `ADMINISTER_PROJECTS`\n *  `BROWSE_PROJECTS`\n *  `MANAGE_SPRINTS_PERMISSION` (Jira Software only)\n *  `SERVICEDESK_AGENT` (Jira Service Desk only)\n *  `VIEW_DEV_TOOLS` (Jira Software only)\n *  `VIEW_READONLY_WORKFLOW`\n\n**Issue permissions**\n\n *  `ASSIGNABLE_USER`\n *  `ASSIGN_ISSUES`\n *  `CLOSE_ISSUES`\n *  `CREATE_ISSUES`\n *  `DELETE_ISSUES`\n *  `EDIT_ISSUES`\n *  `LINK_ISSUES`\n *  `MODIFY_REPORTER`\n *  `MOVE_ISSUES`\n *  `RESOLVE_ISSUES`\n *  `SCHEDULE_ISSUES`\n *  `SET_ISSUE_SECURITY`\n *  `TRANSITION_ISSUES`\n\n**Voters and watchers permissions**\n\n *  `MANAGE_WATCHERS`\n *  `VIEW_VOTERS_AND_WATCHERS`\n\n**Comments permissions**\n\n *  `ADD_COMMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_ALL_COMMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_OWN_COMMENTS`\n *  `EDIT_ALL_COMMENTS`\n *  `EDIT_OWN_COMMENTS`\n\n**Attachments permissions**\n\n *  `CREATE_ATTACHMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_ALL_ATTACHMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_OWN_ATTACHMENTS`\n\n**Time tracking permissions**\n\n *  `DELETE_ALL_WORKLOGS`\n *  `DELETE_OWN_WORKLOGS`\n *  `EDIT_ALL_WORKLOGS`\n *  `EDIT_OWN_WORKLOGS`\n *  `WORK_ON_ISSUES`\n\n**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira.",

In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).\n\nProject roles are used in [permission schemes](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](#api-rest-api-3-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](#api-rest-api-3-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](#api-rest-api-3-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.\n\n#### Members and actors ####\n\nIn the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.\n\nActors may be set as [default members](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg#Managingprojectroles-Specifying'defaultmembers'foraprojectrole) of the project role or set at the project level:\n\n *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects.

Note that for Connect apps, the app user must have the required permissions for the operation and the app must \nhave scopes that permit the operation.\n\nA permission can be granted to a group, project role, or issue role that the user is a member of, or granted directly to a user. \nSee [Permissions overview](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) for details. The most common permissions are:\n\n- **Administer the Cloud site**: Users in the _site-admins_ group have this \npermission. See [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) for details.\n- **Administer Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Administrators_ global permission. There is a default group for this permission. \nSee [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) and [Managing global permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) for details.\n- **Administer a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Administer projects_ project permission for a project. This can be \ngranted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. \nSee [Managing project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for details.\n- **Access a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Browse projects_ project permission for a project. This can be \ngranted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. \nSee [Managing project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for details.\n- **Access Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Users_ global permission. Users in the default product access group (for example, \n_jira-software-users-acmesite_) have this permission. \nSee [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) and \n[Managing global permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) for details.\n\n### Anonymous access\n\nSome operations provide support for anonymous access. However, anonymous access is only available if \nthe Jira permission needed to access the object or records returned by the operation is granted to \nthe _Public_ group. See [Allowing anonymous access to your project](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/GDxxLg) \nfor details.\n\nIf an operation is called anonymously and anonymous access is not available, the operation will return \nan error.

        "title": "Expansion, pagination, and ordering",
        "anchor": "expansion",
        "body": "### Expansion\n\nThe Jira REST API uses resource expansion, which means that some parts of a resource are not returned unless specified \nin the request. This simplifies responses and minimizes network traffic.\n\nTo expand part of a resource in a request, use the expand query parameter and specify the object(s) to be expanded. \nIf you need to expand nested objects, use the `.` dot notation. If you need to expand multiple objects, use a \ncomma-separated list. \n\nFor example, the following request expands the `names` and `renderedFields` properties for the _JRACLOUD-34423_ issue:\n\n`GET issue/JRACLOUD-34423?expand=names,renderedFields`\n\nTo discover which object can be expanded, refer to the `expand` property in the object. \nIn the JSON example below, the resource declares `widgets` as expandable.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"expand\": \"widgets\", \n  \"self\": \"https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/resource/KEY-1\", \n  \"widgets\": {\n    \"widgets\": [],\n    \"size\": 5\n   }\n}\n```\n\n### Pagination\n\nThe Jira REST API uses pagination to improve performance. Pagination is enforced for operations that could return a large \ncollection of items. When you make a request to a paginated resource, the response wraps the returned array of values in \na JSON object with paging metadata. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"startAt\" : 0,\n    \"maxResults\" : 10,\n    \"total\": 200,\n    \"isLast\": false,\n    \"values\": [\n        { /* result 0 */ },\n        { /* result 1 */ },\n        { /* result 2 */ }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n*   `startAt` is the index of the first item returned in the page.\n*   `maxResults` is the maximum number of items that a page can return. Each operation can have a different limit for\n    the number of items returned, and these limits may change without notice. To find the maximum number of items \n    that an operation could return, set `maxResults` to a large number—for example, over 1000—and if the returned value of `maxResults` is less than the requested value, the returned value is the maximum.\n*    `total` is the total number of items contained in all pages. This number **_may change_** as the client \nrequests the subsequent pages, therefore the client should always assume that the requested page can be empty. Note \nthat this property is not returned for all operations.\n*   `isLast` indicates whether the page returned is the last one. Note that this property is not returned for all operations.\n\n### Ordering\n\nSome operations support ordering the elements of a response by a field. Check the documentation for the operation to \nconfirm whether ordering of a response is supported and which fields can be used. Responses are listed in ascending order \nby default. You can change the order using the `orderby` query parameter with a `-` or `+` symbol. For example:\n\n*   `?orderBy=name` to order by `name` field ascending.\n*   `?orderBy=+name` to order by `name` field ascending.\n*   `?orderBy=-name` to order by `name` field descending.\n\n\n"

Otherwise the request is blocked by cross-site request forgery (CSRF/XSRF) protection.\n-   `X-Force-Accept-Language` (request): controls how the standard HTTP `Accept-Language` header is processed.\nBy default `Accept-Language` is ignored and the response is in the language configured in the user's profile or,\nwhen no language is configured for the user, the default Jira instance language.
