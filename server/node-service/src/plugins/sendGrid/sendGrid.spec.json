                "description": "The Mail Send endpoint allows you to send email over SendGrid’s v3 Web API, the most recent version of our API. If you are looking for documentation about the v2 Mail Send endpoint, see our [v2 API Reference](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html).\n\n## Helper Libraries\n\nTwilio SendGrid provides libraries to help you quickly and easily integrate with the v3 Web API in 7 different languages:\n\n* [C#](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp) \n* [Go](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-go)\n* [Java](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-java)\n* [Node JS](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs)\n* [PHP](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php)\n* [Python](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python)\n* [Ruby](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby)\n\n## Dynamic Transactional Templates and Handlebars\n\nIn order to send a dynamic template, specify the template ID with the `template_id` parameter. \n\nTo specify handlebar substitutions, define your substitutions in the request JSON with this syntax:\n\n```\n\"dynamic_template_data\": {\n      \"guest\": \"Jane Doe\",\n      \"partysize\": \"4\",\n      \"english\": true,\n      \"date\": \"April 1st, 2021\"\n    }\n```\n\nFor more information about Dynamic Transactional Templates and Handlebars, see our documentation and reference pages.\n\n* [How to send an email with Dynamic Transactional Templates\n](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-transactional-templates/)\n* [Using Handlebars](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/using-handlebars/) \n\n## Mail Body Compression\n\nMail body compression is available to some high volume accounts. Talk to your CSM if you are interested in this functionality. Mail body compression works by setting up a JSON payload as defined on this page, then compressing it with gzip (the gzip file can be no more than 30mb).\n\nTo use mail body compression:\n\n1. Add a `Content-Encoding` header, with a value of `gzip`.  \n   a. `Content-Encoding: gzip` \n2. Send the gzip as a data-binary.  \n   a. `--data-binary '@data.json.gz'\n`\n\n## Multiple Reply-To Emails\n\nUsing `reply_to_list` allows senders to include more than one recipient email address to receive reply and/or bounce messages from the recipient of the email.\n\n### Usage Considerations\n\n* `reply_to` is mutually exclusive with `reply_to_list`. If both are used, then the API call will be rejected. \n* The `reply_to_list` object, when used, must at least have an email parameter and may also contain a name parameter.\n* Each email address in the `reply_to_list` should be unique.\n* There is a limit of 1000 `reply_to_list` emails per mail/send request.\n* In SMTP calls, we will omit any invalid emails.\n\n### Possible 400 Error Messages\n\n* `reply_to` is mutually exclusive with `reply_to_list`.\n* The `reply_to_list` object, when used, must at least have an email parameter and may also contain a name parameter.\n* Each email address in the `reply_to_list` should be unique.\n* There is a limit of X `reply_to` emails per mail/send request.\n* The `reply_to_list` email does not contain a valid address.\n* The `reply_to_list` email exceeds the maximum total length of X characters.\n* The `reply_to_list` email parameter is required.",

Once you have created a first key with scopes to manage additional API keys, you can use this API for all other key management.\n\n> There is a limit of 100 API Keys on your account.\n\nA JSON request body containing a `name` property is required when making requests to this endpoint. If the number of maximum keys, 100, is reached, a `403` status will be returned.\n\nThough the `name` field is required, it does not need to be unique. A unique API key ID will be generated for each key you create and returned in the response body.\n\nIt is not necessary to pass a `scopes` field to the API when creating a key, but you should be aware that omitting the `scopes` field from your request will create a key with \"Full Access\" permissions by default.\n\nSee the [API Key Permissions List](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/how-to-use-the-sendgrid-v3-api/api-authorization) for all available scopes. An API key's scopes can be updated after creation using the \"Update API keys\" endpoint.",

However, any modifications to your `list` of entries will overwrite the entire list. For this reason, you must included all existing entries you wish to retain in your `list` in addition to any new entries you intend to add. To remove one or more `list` entries, pass a `list` with only the entries you wish to retain.\n\nYou should not add generic domains such as `gmail.com` or `yahoo.com`  in your `list` because your emails will not honor recipients' unsubscribes. This may cause a legal violation of [CAN-SPAM](https://sendgrid.com/docs/glossary/can-spam/) and could damage your sending reputation.\n\nThe Address Whitelist setting allows you to specify email addresses or domains for which mail should never be suppressed.\n\nFor example, if you own the domain `example.com`, and one or more of your recipients use `email@example.com` addresses, placing `example.com` in the address whitelist setting instructs Twilio SendGrid to ignore all bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes logged for that domain. In other words, all bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes will still be sent to `example.com` as if they were sent under normal sending conditions.",

When using Automated Security, SendGrid provides you with three CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you are instead given TXT and MX records.\n\nIf you pass a `link_id` to this endpoint, the generated email will supply the DNS records necessary to complete [Link Branding](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-link-branding/) setup. If you pass a `domain_id` to this endpoint, the generated email will supply the DNS records needed to complete [Domain Authentication](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/). Passing both IDs will generate an email with the records needed to complete both setup steps.\n\nYou can retrieve all your domain IDs from the returned `id` fields for each domain using the \"List all authenticated domains\" endpoint.

This name change is only a convenience, as the duplicate will be assigned a unique ID that differentiates it from your other designs.\n\nYou can modify your duplicate’s name at the time of creation by passing an updated value to the `name` field when making the initial request.\nMore on retrieving design IDs can be found below.",

Rather, it will contain an HTTP 202 response indicating the contacts are queued for processing or an HTTP 4XX error containing validation errors. Should you wish to get the resulting contact's ID or confirm your contacts have been updated or added, you can use the \"Get Contacts by Emails\" endpoint. \n\nPlease note that custom fields need to have been already created if you wish to set their values for the contacts being upserted. To do this, please use the \"Create Custom Field Definition\" endpoint.\n\nYou will see a `job_id` in the response to your request. This can be used to check the status of your upsert job. To do so, please use the \"Import Contacts Status\" endpoint.\n\nIf the contact already exists in the system, any entries submitted via this endpoint will update the existing contact. The contact to update will be determined only by the `email` field and any fields omitted from the request will remain as they were. A contact's ID cannot be used to update the contact.\n\nThe email field will be changed to all lower-case. If a contact is added with an email that exists but contains capital letters, the existing contact with the all lower-case email will be updated.",

                "description": "**This endpoint allows a CSV upload containing up to one million contacts or 5GB of data, whichever is smaller.**\n\nImports take place asynchronously: the endpoint returns a URL (`upload_uri`) and HTTP headers (`upload_headers`) which can subsequently be used to `PUT` a file of contacts to be  imported into our system.\n\nUploaded CSV files may also be [gzip-compressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip).\n\nIn either case, you must include the field `file_type` with the value `csv` in your request body.\n\nThe `field_mappings` paramter is a respective list of field definition IDs to map the uploaded CSV columns to. It allows you to use CSVs where one or more columns are skipped (`null`) or remapped to the contact field. \n\nFor example, if `field_mappings` is set to `[null, \"w1\", \"_rf1\"]`, this means skip column 0, map column 1 to the custom field with the ID `w1`, and map column 2 to the reserved field with the ID `_rf1`. See the \"Get All Field Definitions\" endpoint to fetch your custom and reserved field IDs to use with `field_mappings`.\n\nOnce you recieve the response body you can then initiate a **second** API call where you use the supplied URL and HTTP header to upload your file. For example:\n\n`curl --upload-file \"file/path.csv\" \"URL_GIVEN\" -H 'HEADER_GIVEN'`\n\nIf you'd like to monitor the status of your import job, use the `job_id` and the \"Import Contacts Status\" endpoint.\n\nTwilio SendGrid recommends exporting your contacts regularly as a backup to avoid issues or lost data.",

The contact object associated with the address, whether it is their `email` or one of their `alternate_emails` will be returned if matched.\n\nEmail addresses in the search request do not need to match the case in which they're stored, but the email addresses in the result will be all lower case. Empty strings are excluded from the search and will not be returned.\n\nThis endpoint should be used in place of the \"Search Contacts\" endpoint when you can provide exact email addresses and do not need to include other [Segmentation Query Language (SGQL)](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/segmentation-query-language/) filters when searching.\n\nIf you need to access a large percentage of your contacts, we recommend exporting your contacts with the \"Export Contacts\" endpoint and filtering the results client side.\n\nThis endpoint returns a `200` status code when any contacts match the address(es) you supplied. When searching multiple addresses in a single request, it is possible that some addresses will match a contact while others will not. When a partially successful search like this is made, the matching contacts are returned in an object and an error message is returned for the email address(es) that are not found. \n\nThis endpoint returns a `404` status code when no contacts are found for the provided email address(es).\n\nA `400` status code is returned if any searched addresses are invalid.\n\nTwilio SendGrid recommends exporting your contacts regularly as a backup to avoid issues or lost data.",

Additionally, a Custom Field name cannot collide with any Reserved Field names. You should save the returned `id` value in order to update or delete the field at a later date. You can have up to 120 custom fields.\n\nThe custom field name should be created using only alphanumeric characters (A-Z and 0-9) and underscores (\\_). Custom fields can only begin with letters  A-Z or underscores (_). The field type can be date, text, or number fields. The field type is important for creating segments from your contact database.\n\n**Note: Creating a custom field that begins with a number will cause issues with sending in Marketing Campaigns.**",

The `name` field length is limited to 100 characters, so the end of the new Single Send name, including “Copy of ”, will be trimmed if the name exceeds this limit.",

When you segment your audience, you are able to create personalized Automation emails and Single Sends that directly address the wants and needs of your particular audience.\n\nThe Marketing Campaigns Segments API allows you to create, edit, and delete segments as well as retrieve a list of segments or an individual segment by ID.\n\n> Note that Twilio SendGrid checks for newly added or modified contacts who meet a segment's criteria on an hourly schedule. Only existing contacts who meet a segment's criteria will be included in the segment searches within 15 minutes.\n>\n> Segments built using engagement data such as \"was sent\" or \"clicked\" will take approximately 30 minutes to begin populating.\n>\n> Segment samples and counts are refreshed approximately once per hour; they do not update immediately. If no contacts are added to or removed from a segment since the last refresh, the sample and UI count displayed will be refreshed at increasing time intervals with a maximum sample and count refresh delay of 24 hours.\n\nFor more information on creating segments with the Twilio SendGrid Marketing Campaigns UI see [\"Segmenting your Contacts.\"](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/managing-contacts/segmenting-your-contacts/)\n\nFor help with Segmentation Query Language, see our [Segmentation Query Language reference](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/segmentation-query-language/)"

API Keys allow you to use another method of authentication separate from your account username and password. API Keys add an additional layer of security for your account and can be assigned [specific permissions](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/API_Keys/api_key_permissions_list.html) to limit which areas of your account they may be used to access. [API Keys can be generated in your account](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys). To use keys, you must set a plain text header named “Authorization” with the contents of the header being “Bearer XXX” where XXX is your API Secret Key.\n\n### Example Header\n\n```bash\nGET https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/resource HTTP/1.1\nAuthorization: Bearer Your.API.Key-HERE\n```\n\n```bash\ncurl -X \"GET\" \"https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/templates\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer Your.API.Key-HERE\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n```",

Once this threshold has been reached, we will return a status code `429` response.\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\nGET https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/resource HTTP/1.1\n```\n\n```json\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 500\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 499\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1392815263\n\n{\n  \"foo\": \"bar\"\n}\n```\n\n## When You Reach a Rate Limit\n\nYou will no longer be able to make request against that endpoint for the duration of that refresh period.\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\nGET https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/resource/ HTTP/1.1\n```\n\n```json\nHTTP/1.1 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS\nContent-Type: application/json\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 150\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 0\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1392815263\n\n{\n  \"errors\": [\n    {\n      \"field\": null,\n       \"message\": \"too many requests\"\n    },\n  ]\n}\n```",

It doesn't currently require the [accept header](http://www.soapui.org/Best-Practices/understanding-rest-headers-and-parameters.html), but might in the future. If not set, the API will use `application/json`.\n\n```bash\nGET https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/endpoint HTTP/1.1\nAccept: application/json\n```\n\n### Arrays of Data\n\nWhen you send an array of data in a `GET` request, you will include the parameter multiple times on the URL. The parameter name does not require brackets.\n\n#### Example Array in a GET request\\\n\n```bash\nGET https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/endpoint?parameter=data1&parameter=data2 HTTP/1.1\n```\n\n## Formatting Your Request\n\n### Request Body\n\nWhen submitting data to a resource via `POST` or `PUT`, you must submit your payload in JSON.\n\n```bash\nPOST https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/templates/ HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"new template name\"\n}\n```\n\n### Pagination\n\nSome `GET` resources allow for retrieval of information in batches. We will provide the query args in the resource documentation when available to consume.\n\nWhen requesting multiple items, we will default the request limit to 500 items. You can specify a different limit but cannot exceed the default limit.\n\nResources documented will display a bolded list of available paginated parameters if available.\n\nBelow is a basic pagination example. In the resource documentation, we will only provide the bolded list of available parameters.\n\n**A [Link Header](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) is provided in the response for batched information.**\n\n```bash\nGET https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/resource?limit=300&offset=10 HTTP/1.1\n```\n\n| **Parameter** | **Description** |\n|---|---|\n| limit | The number of records to return |\n| offset | The number of records to skip |\n\n### Search & Paramters\n\nSome resources allow for you to search by a specific field. Other resources require you to append a parameter to the URI.\n\nIn this example, we will display a paginated URI example, searching for resources where the email contains `foo`.\n\n```bash\nGET https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/resource?email=foo&bar=baz HTTP/1.1\n```\n\n## Successful Requests\n\nBelow is a general overview of what resource objects return with successful Web API requests.\n\n| **Verb** | **Resource object returned** |\n|---|---|\n| GET | Returns a single resource object or array of resource objects |\n| PATCH | Returns the updated resource object |\n| PUT | Returns the updated resource object |\n| DELETE | No content is returned |\n| POST | Returns the newly created resource object |",
